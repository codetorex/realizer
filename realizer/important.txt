About texture format conversions
-----------------------------------------------
* Currently texture format converters named ARGB are actually stored in memory B G R A if you read
sequently because GPU takes them as DWORD's and which is endianness is getting diffrent?

* Do we need to do something about it?

*** I named everything about color order by their byte order. And default order is now R G B A.
When its uploaded to GPU it is automatically converted to appropriate data format.
